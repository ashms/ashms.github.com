Continuing that theme further, he joined Concrete Canoe because making a canoe out of concrete makes perfect sense.

                            <p>An honorary engineer by pressure (peer pressure), Zach helped MCCT revamp and refresh their identity in the summer of 2009. A marketer-in-training, Zach helped to raise funds in sponsorships with some local businesses. Although he is gone in body, he is not gone in spirit or artistic freelance work. Zach still helps the team by providing graphic designs for the team's theme, paper, or whatever they e-mail him six weeks out from competition. His humor may be missed, but maybe it isn't because the laughter he provided sometimes halted important canoe production. Anyways, he wishes the team well every year and will always be willing to help out.</p>

Outside of the team Nate is the program chair of the NAME Quarterdeck Society, and a peer mentor the Naval Architecture Engineering 100 section.

                            <p>Zack is a team member that "doesn't fit". A New Jersey native, Zack is one of the few east coast members on the MCC team, but one of the many from the region that attend U of M. Moreover, he isn't the typical concrete canoe teammate. He is (maybe now the only??) Biomedical Engineer on the team, and interestingly enough, has more of an interest in medicine than engineering. Zack joined as a freshman, and this year will be his fourth year on the team. On a snowy day in March 2011, Zack attended UM for an Engineering Campus Day; during a tour of the Wilson Center, he first saw the concrete canoe team at work. When he realized concrete really can float, he knew he would love to join the team. He plans to continue his role of canoe-design and construction. Last year, he earned the title "Mixmaster" for mixing the cement that made up the canoe on pour day (of course with help). Zack loves music, especially electronic dance music, and sports, and is even an athlete on the University of Michigan Men's Varsity and Club Lacrosse teams. Ultimately, he hopes to bring home some trophies for the Michigan Concrete Canoe team before his time is done. </p>

                            <p>First year with concrete canoe (2014-2015). Enjoys the small team aspect of the group, being able to be part of every aspect. Aspiring aerospace engineer with graduation expected in 2018. From all over, but MI is definitely one of the best places other than maybe Italy or Portugal where he lived for a while. Enjoys listening to music, reading, cooking, and traveling. Especially traveling. </p>
